What is Maven, Where we can use it and Basic Concepts on iy.

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. 
Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. Using maven we can build and manage any Java based project.

POM stands for Project Object Model. It is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that resides in the base directory of the project as pom.xml.

The POM contains information about the project and various configuration detail used by Maven to build the project(s).
POM also contains the goals and plugins. While executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, and then executes the goal. Some of the configuration that can be specified in the POM are following âˆ’

project dependencies
plugins
goals
build profiles
project version
developers
mailing list

It should be noted that there should be a single POM file for each project.

* All POM files require the project element and three mandatory fields: groupId, artifactId, version.

* Projects notation in repository is groupId:artifactId:version.
